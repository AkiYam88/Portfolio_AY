            <h3 class="section-title">the problem</h3>
            <p><br>
                GSRNC is in successful operation for 16 years. The organization website is the primary point of contact for many potential volunteers and adopters, but the contents are not organized in the optimal way that the site has evolved and added its contents over time. 
            <br><br>
                Also, the website is not responsive. Laptops are the primary devices to view the site at the adoption and fundraising events. Currently, it requires more clicks than you should have to. Smartphones are the device of choice in other settings such as a meet-and-greet with adopters - they have to navigate through the full-size website shrunk to a much smaller screen size to call up the dog’s information.
            <br><br>
            My responsibilities on the project are to 1. reorganize the pages/contents for better user experience, and 2. excecute the complete UI makeover to transform the site into a responsive one. </p>

            <h5>SWOT Analysis</h5>
            <p>To better understand the industry, SWOT analysis was conducted on rescue organizations in the same geographic area:
            </p>
            <ol class="cs-bullets">
                <li>San Francisco SPCA</li>
                <li>Humane Society Silicon Valley</li>
                <li>MuttVille – Senior Dog Rescue</li>
                <li>Rocket Dog Rescue</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>
                Based on the SWOT analysis results, the following categories were to be the main areas of focus on this project:
            </p>
            <ol class="cs-bullets">
                <li>Less text: This type of websites are prone to be text-overload with information of each animal, non-profit status documentation, etc. It is critical to keep the text volume as small as possible to avoid overwhelming users.</li>
                <li>White space: Similar to “less text,” less-is-more is true to overall page layout in order to have such elements as dog pictures, event information to be as visible as possible.</li>
                <li>SNS presence: The organization is increasing the SNS activities to promote more adoptions. It is important to feature the SNS connection in more prominent positions.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Lofi (Balsamiq) and hifi (Sketch) wireframes were created in several iterations to determine effective page layouts. At this stage I created 3 options of home page along with the basic structures of second and third level pages.<br>My main focus there was to create friendlier user interfaces for the visiters to browse dogs and find information hustle-free.
            <br><br>
            I started collecting icons and additional pictures from stock photography and the existing organizatoin site.
            </p>
            <h5>Mockups</h5>
            <p>I applied colors, pictues, and icons on the layout to create mockups. Once it was finalized, the pages were inported into InVision to set up the clickable prototype.<br><br>Examples are shown below.</p>

            <p><br>There was no change on the existing logo at this makeover, so my task was to choose the new color palette, and typefaces. </p>

            <h5>Color Palette</h5>
            <p>The site featured the variety of pictures and it was important to enhance them, so monochromatic tones of black, white and gray were selected as main colors. For highlights, I picked orange (for German Shepherd dog's amber eyes), muted green (for grasses they are running on), and brown (for their coat color). </p>
            
            <h5>Typefaces</h5>
            <p>I selected Catamaran typefaces. It was important for the site to be approachable to attract viewers but I wanted to avoid it to look too cute as the organization specialized in the breed that was often associated with low enforcement and military organizations  (coinsidentally many of volunteers and adopters have such backgrounds).<br>So I researched websites of police departments and military organizations such as US Army, SFPD, and FBI, and concluded that an appropriate choice would be sans-serif that was not too round. Catamaran fitted those criteria while it did not look too office-y with less rigid numerics. </p>

            <p><br>I am an active volunteer member of the organization and the project is near and dear to me. <br><br>Going into the project the challenge I expected to happen was a reorganization of existing information as the site contained quite a lot. Another challenge I thought of was how to create an effective website for multiple user groups with different needs (adopter, prospect, and active volunteer). But adhering to the UX/UI processes kept me on course to divide and conquer each step (thank you personas user flows and sitemaps!). <br><br>The curveball the project threw at me was how tricky it was to come up with 50+ icons that were appropriate for each category yet clearly different from each other. I was glad that I had gone through this process as it gave me an opportunity to examine each category from different angles to come up with the icons that felt right. <br><br>The lesson I've known but have re-learned during the project was the importance of a solid foundation. By putting time and effort to build the accurate-as-possible wireframes and mockups in at least a few different options, it is much easier to work on more details in prototype and coding stage.<br><br>One thing I would change if I had more time: I would've built the complete clickable prototype and the actual website for every page in the site.   </p>
